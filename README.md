# Admin Dashboard - The Odin Project

This project is a webpage created based on this design:

The main purpose is put in practice the CSS Grid module I learned recently in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Furthermore, I can use any tool like Flexbox for layout, but, as the main scope is Grid, I use this one in any situation where Flexbox could be even an easier solution.
